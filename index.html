        <p>I seek to understand my clients and the problems they need to solve. Then I use my research skills and past experiences to find solutions to fit their needs and budgets.</p>
        <p>I love helping clients connect with their target audience through good design that tells their story. Good design is good business. This is why I strive to optimize websites so that they work for my clients, not against them. I find that there is nothing more fulfilling than seeing a company grow through the power of their web site.</p>
